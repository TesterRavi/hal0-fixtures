If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the Prep Bowl, cover, Blade Assembly and spatula on the upper shelf. Insert the Prep Bowl upside-down and the cover right-side up. Put the blade and spatula in the cutlery basket. Unload the dishwasher carefully to avoid contact with the sharp blade. Wipe the motor base clean with a damp sponge or cloth. Dry it immediately. Never submerge the motor base or the plug in water or other liquid. The Mini-Prep stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. When it is not in use, be sure to leave it unplugged.

Fossflakes sleep technology from Denmark, this Danish Sleep Pillow\'s fill consists of the finest flakes made from pure 100% polyethylene foil blended with a revolutionary blend of polyester fibers. Each Fossflakes flake is as unique as a snowflake, characterized by its own pretension and memory, significantly improving the down-like feel of the pillow, enhances the distribution of the pillow\'s fill and greatly reduces the clumping and compaction found in natural down and most filling materials. Lab tests show that you can wash and dry the pillow up to 50 times and it will still retain its superior resilience and shape. Another unique feature of our imported Fossflakes fill is its superior temperature regulation properties; flakes allow the pillows to stay cooler by allowing air to circulate within the pillow and around your head while you enjoy a restful sleep.\n- Made in the U.S.A with imported Fossflakes sleep technology from Denmark\n- 375 thread count\n- This pillow is ideal for side, stomach, and back sleepers\n- 100% hypoallergenic \n- Support: medium\n- Color: white\n- Imported\n\nProduct measurements: \n- Standard: 20\" x 26\"\n- King: 20\" x 36\"\r\n\r\nPlease note your order will be shipped directly from the brand.

Filled with specially engineered down alternative fiber for a comfortable, warm and restful sleep, this unique comforter has a Microfiber cover that is soft to the touch, easy care and dries quickly. Also features a classic knife-edge finish and baffle box stitch construction, which keeps the down alternative fill from shifting for an even layer of warmth. \n- Color: white\n- 100% hypoallergenic\n- Comes in your choice of four beautiful colors\n- Imported\n\nProduct measurements:\n- Twin: 66\" x 86\"\n- Full/Queen: 86\" x 86\"\n- King: 102\" x 86\"\n\nPlease note your order will be shipped directly from the brand.

The original masterpiece was created in 1889, today it has been carefully recreated detail-by-detail to near perfection as a complete canvas art reproduction. One of today\'s most recognized paintings, Starry Night by Vincent Van Gogh is a classic painting that invokes emotions from the serenity of the church steeple to the wild abandon of color used for his late night sky. Imagine the movement of the painter as he twists and turns his brush to create the dance between the stars and the clouds under the calm, peaceful village. Vincent Van Gogh\'s restless spirit and depressive mental state fired his artistic work with great joy and, sadly, equally great despair. Known as a prolific Post-Impressionist, he produced many paintings that were heavily biographical. This work of art has the same emotions and beauty as the original by Van Gogh.
